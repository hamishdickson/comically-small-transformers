# Comically Small Transformers

This is a learning repo. In this repo I implement various transformer models from scratch. The goal is to understand the transformer architecture and its working in depth.

This repo is HEAVILY based on the [excellent video](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=ciY6QYc7iLsRguEv) from Karpathy and his [nanoGPT repo](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)

I have made no attempt to optimise these models for production or so that you can load them into HuggingFace. This is purely for learning purposes.
